    "longTip": "Use semantic HTML elements that clearly define their content as much as possible. By using semantic elements you provide the user with a more meaningful way to navigate and interact with your website. Semantic elements, such as `<header>`, `<main>` and `<article>` are by default accessible compared to non-semantic elements like `div` or `span`. Avoid using non-accessible `<div class=\"button\">` when `<button>` is already available for you. If for some reason you must use non-semantic elements be sure to implement accessibility functionality to them.",

    "longTip": "Let users skip long navigation by implementing invisible focusable link that leads to main content. Screen readers perceive the page from top to bottom which means that if there is no skip-link implemented and the website is already familiar to the end user, the screen reader will read redundant navigation.",
