### Avoid anti-semantic patterns

### Detailed explanation
Use semantic HTML elements that clearly define their content as much as possible. By using semantic elements you provide the user with a more meaningful way to navigate and interact with your website. Semantic elements, such as `<header>`, `<main>` and `<article>` are by default accessible compared to non-semantic elements like `div` or `span`. Avoid using non-accessible `<div class="button">` when `<button>` is already available for you. If for some reason you must use non-semantic elements be sure to implement accessibility functionality to them.
