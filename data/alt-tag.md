### Always include alt tag on an image

Screen readers for the blind and visually impaired read out `alt` tag text and therefore make your images accessible. `alt` tag should describe meaningful images and be left empty if the image serves decorative purposes. Never leave the `alt` since screen readers will read the source of the image which makes for terrible user experience.
