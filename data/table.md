### When you need to display tabular data use `table` instead series of `div` elements

When you need to display some tabular data be sure to use the semantically correct `<table>` element as it is accessible by default, in contrast to non-semantic elements like `<div>`. You should provide a `<caption>` for your `<table>` element and allow users to skip through the table with a skip-link if they don't want it read by the screen reader.
