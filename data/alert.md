### Alert user for updates

Make on the fly content changes accessible by making use of `WAI-ARIA` attributes on those elements. When notifying the user about certain behavior use `aria-life` attribute to let the screen reader know about new changes. Set the value of `aria-life` to `polite` if your changes aren't urgent or use `aria-life="assertive"` if you want to notify the user immediately.
